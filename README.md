**Description:**

This Android application, coded in Java, features three primary activities: **LoginActivity, LoadingActivity**, and **MainActivity**, which form a continuous cycle. The app was developed to address the need for real-time monitoring of my hunting or household pet. Utilizing the TMT250 portable GPS tracker for the dog, which boasts a battery life of approximately 10-12 hours, the app sends GPS data to a server. This server then records the latest location in a database and publishes relevant data to MQTT broker topics, ensuring real-time updates rather than delayed requests. Upon app launch, a single request is made to the server to retrieve the most recent known location of the pet. The application has the potential to cater to other pets and incorporate additional functionalities, such as:

• **Implementing geofencing** to receive alerts when the pet leaves a designated area,

• **Integrating a health monitoring feature** to track the pet's activity levels and vital signs,

• Adding a **social component** to connect with other pet owners in the vicinity,

• Incorporating a **training module** with customizable commands and rewards,

• Integrating a **camera feature** to capture photos or videos of the pet's adventures,

• Implementing a **virtual leash feature** to automatically adjust GPS boundaries based on the pet's movement and behavior patterns.
